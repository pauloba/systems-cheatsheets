BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. 
It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. 
The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; 
however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. 
BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.

BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind. 
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or features) at compile time. 
This makes it easy to customize your embedded systems. 
To create a working system, just add some device nodes in /dev, a few configuration files in /etc, and a Linux kernel.

GIT


How do I ignore an error on 'git pull' about my local changes would be overwritten by merge?


If you want remove all local changes - including files that are untracked by git - from your working copy, simply stash them:

git stash push --include-untracked
If you don't need them anymore, you now can drop that stash:

git stash drop
If you don't want to stash changes that you already staged - e.g. with git add - then add the option --keep-index. Note however, that this will still prevent merging if those staged changes collide with the ones from upstream.
